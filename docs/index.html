<h3>What is the SaaS Tech Radar?</h3>

<p>
The SaaS Tech Radar is a list of technologies, complemented by an assessment result, called <em>ring assignment</em>. We use four rings with the following semantics:
</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>INVEST</strong> &mdash; Tools we have high confidence in to serve our purpose, also in large scale. Tools we want to encourage usage of and want to develop and research further. Thinking about what initiatives we can do to enhance the experience.</li>
<li><strong>SUPPORT</strong> &mdash; Tools commonly used within the company and have a high usage, however no further investments are being done at the moment but rather keeping the status quo.</li>
<li><strong>OBSOLETE</strong> &mdash; Tools we want to move away from and not further invest in - current migration projects or alternatives are being investigated. The tool is not recommended to be used for new projects.</li>
<li><strong>UNSUPPORTED</strong> &mdash; Tools that have been decomissioned, decided against or simply  is not a tool being supported.</li>
</ul>

</td><td>

<h3>What is the purpose?</h3>

<p>
The SaaS Tech Radar is a tool to inspire and support teams to pick the best technologies for new projects. Based on the <a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar">ThoughtWorks Tech Radar</a>, this radar sets out to find a pulse of where we are heading and what products we are investing our time in.
ech-radar could be used to also visualise internal work with SaaS applications and other productivity apps - From here on known as "Tools".

This fork aims to create a framework for how to describe and talk about SaaS applications internally.

It's an forever growing market - being able to visualise internally and publically how you think regarding SaaS applications could be an interesting way to see where you are heading and where you want to be.

SaaS Radar is forked from <a href="https://github.com/zalando/tech-radar">Zalandos Tech Radar</a> from which efforts this radar would not have existed.
