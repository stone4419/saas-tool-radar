<h2>Assess</h2>
<p>Tools and ideas worth exploring further, we see great potential in these products. We want to evaluate how they would fit in our workspace.</p>

<h3>What is the SaaS Tool Radar?</h3>

<p>
The SaaS Tool Radar is a tool to inspire and visualize our organization's tools for productivity. Based on the <a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar">ThoughtWorks Tech Radar</a>, this radar sets out to establish a pulse of where we are heading and what tools we investing our time in.
</p>

<p>
The goal is to create a framework for describing, visualizing, and talking about SaaS applications internally.

It's a forever growing market of applications. Visualizing internally and publicly how you think regarding SaaS applications could be an exciting way to see where you are heading and where you want to be.

SaaS Tool Radar is forked from <a href="https://github.com/zalando/tech-radar">Zalando's Tech Radar</a> from which efforts this radar would not have existed.
