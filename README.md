Based on the [fantastic work by ThoughtWorks](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar) and [forked from Zalandos Tech Radar](http://zalando.github.io/tech-radar/) the aim of the **SaaS Tool Radar** is to provide a equivilent framework for SaaS-powered workspaces. 

I's an ever growing market of SaaS applications - being able to visualise internally and publically how you think regarding 
SaaS applications could be an interesting way to see where you are heading and where you want to be.
